  <h3> Welcome to the data repository! </h3>
</p>

I'll tell you a little bit about what it is.

**Ren'Py RhythmBeats is a 2-track rhythm action system that allows you to integrate basic rhythm game mechanics into a visual novel made in Ren'Py. It's rare to find visual novels with rhythm games, but this is a crazy idea that came to my mind because of my fanaticism for rhythm games.

#### BENEFITS RHYTHMBEATS!

**Simplicity:** The rhythm system proposed by **Ren'Py RhythmBeats!** is minimalistic and can be played easily by almost anyone.
** Unusual:** In visual novels, such mini-games are rarely seen. Adding this rhythm system to a visual novel could be revolutionary :3
*You can try it!:** I've created a demo game called **"Ren'Py'Py RhythmBeats! Game "**, which is playable on Windows and Android. The game has a total of 19 songs from Project SEKAI and Love Live!

#### LACKS Ren'Py RHYTHMBEATS!

**May be slow:** Unfortunately, Ren'Py is not a high performance engine, mainly because Python is not a fast language. On a computational level **Ren'Py RhythmBeats!** has no problems, but on a graphical level it can have FPS drops.
** Multitouch:** I'm trying to extend support for touchscreens and Android, but since Ren'Py doesn't have stable Multitouch support, you might be more comfortable playing from a keyboard than a touchscreen.

    - I have completed the rollout of the new global update v1.01.0b.
    - The game "Ren'Py RhythmBeats!" now has an experimental port for Android.
    
[22/02/2023 20:17:17 GMT -3]:
    - I will try to recalibrate the songs, as I noticed some delays in the beatmaps.
      This recalibration will be reflected in an upcoming in-game update.
    - I received a request for the translation of the Ren'Py RhythmBeats content into other languages :3
      languages :3
      I will need to update the documentation as the module has received major changes.
